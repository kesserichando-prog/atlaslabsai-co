## Outreach Strategy Notes

### Best Approach
1. **Shop Floor Focus:** Talk about improving throughput and efficiency
2. **Respect Craftsmanship:** Emphasize automation enhances, doesn't replace
3. **Quantitative Results:** Show concrete time and cost savings
4. **Pilot First:** Start small, prove value
5. **Veteran Connection:** Efficiency, precision, discipline align with values
6. **ROI Demonstration:** Clear payback within 12 months

### Likely Objections & Responses
- **"We've been doing it this way for 14 years"** → "Competition is modernizing, customers expect faster quotes"
- **"We can't afford it"** → "ROI calculator shows 9-month payback; efficiency gains pay for it"
- **"We don't need new systems"** → "Your competitors have them; they're quoting faster and communicating better"
- **"It will disrupt production"** → "Phased implementation during planned downtime"
- **"We're a hands-on shop, not a software company"** → "Automation gives you more time for hands-on work"

### Message Framing
- "Help Thomas honor Patrick's legacy by modernizing what they built"
- "Stop spending hours on quotes; spend that time on fabrication"
- "Competitors with automation are winning with faster responses"
- "Give customers the real-time status they expect in 2026"

## Key Insights for Outreach

1. **Veteran Angle:** Use the Marine Corps story as a connection point. Efficiency and discipline resonate.

2. **Family Business:** Frame automation as honoring what Patrick built - modernizing for the next generation.

3. **Craftsmanship Respect:** Don't suggest replacing their skills. Automate the "paperwork" so they can focus on fabrication.

4. **Compressed Timeline:** Thomas took over from his father in 2020. He's likely 5 years into ownership and might be feeling operational pain now.

5. **Industry Knowledge:** Custom fabrication shops either modernize or get squeezed. Position as competitive necessity, not optional upgrade.
