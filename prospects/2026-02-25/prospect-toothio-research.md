**Key Roles:**

## Additional Research Recommendations

If pursuing this prospect (higher priority due to tech-forward model but needs validation):

**To Verify Company Legitimacy and Fit:**
1. Access LinkedIn company profile (employee count, team, growth)
2. Check Crunchbase for funding, valuation, investors
3. Find founders/leadership background (tech experience or传统 staffing?)
4. Verify incorporation date and business registration
5. Look for press coverage, announcements

**To Assess Readiness:**
1. Determine current tech stack and platform capabilities
2. Identify current operational bottlenecks
3. Assess resource availability for automation investment
4. Understand company growth goals and timeline
5. Determine if bootstrapped or VC-funded (affects budget and priorities)

**Outreach Strategy:**

2. Tech-forward messaging - speak platform, not just efficiency
3. Consider equity/partnership model vs. paid engagement
4. Connect via LinkedIn for founders with tech backgrounds

## Unique Consideration: Equity Partnership

For early-stage tech platforms like Toothio, may be opportunities for:

- Strategic partnership with long-term alignment
This differs from traditional service relationships and could create larger upside.

2. May not have budget for paid automation engagements
3. Platform may still be finding product-market fit
4. Competitors could emerge quickly
5. Dental market may have barriers to platform adoption

**Due Diligence Before Engagement:**
- Verify actual operations and client base (not just concept)
- Assess current revenue and cash flow
- Confirm funding status and runway
- Verify platform actually live and operational
- Speak with current clients (if possible)
- Understand competitor landscape specifically for dental
