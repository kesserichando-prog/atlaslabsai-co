  "summary": "Found 4 qualified prospects in Phoenix area with clear automation gaps. Top priority: Arizona Same Day Trucking (Trust Score: 73, Opportunity: 82) - dispatch-heavy operations with strong customer reputation. AZ Insurance Team (Trust Score: 71, Opportunity: 78) - manual multi-carrier quoting with immediate email automation fix needed. MetzFab Industries (Trust Score: 66, Opportunity: 76) - advanced fabrication shop with complex scheduling needs. Precision Metal Products LLC (Trust Score: 58, Opportunity: 72) - smaller family-owned shop with manual processes. All prospects meet the minimum 50-point Trust Score threshold. Different industries explored: Insurance, Logistics, Manufacturing - avoiding previously researched construction, HOA, accounting, cannabis segments.",
  "recommendation": "Prioritize Arizona Same Day Trucking ( highest opportunity score, dispatch automation has clear ROI) and AZ Insurance Team (immediate email automation opportunity + quoting efficiency). Manufacturing prospects are solid but may have longer sales cycles. Recommend phased approach with pilot projects starting with obvious wins (dispatch, quoting, email automation)."
