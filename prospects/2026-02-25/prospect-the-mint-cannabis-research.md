## Technology Assessment

### Current Stack (Inferred)
Given MSO status and innovation focus, likely uses:
- **POS System**: One of major cannabis POS vendors (Cova, Greenbits, Meadow, Flowhub, LeafLogix)
- **Seed-to-Sale**: Metrc (required in all states where they operate)
- **E-commerce**: Custom website with online ordering
- **Loyalty**: Likely integrated with POS or custom system
- **Inventory**: Basic inventory management through POS
- **Compliance**: Manual processes using Metrc state systems
- **CRM**: Basic customer data in POS system

### Automation Gaps (Likely)
- **Multi-state compliance**: No centralized aggregation across states (likely manual)
- **Inventory forecasting**: Manual or spreadsheet-based
- **Workforce scheduling**: For 24/7 operations across multiple locations—likely manual
- **Customer personalization**: Loyalty program exists but likely manual redemption
- **Predictive analytics**: Limited
- **Cross-location intelligence**: Operational dashboards likely basic
