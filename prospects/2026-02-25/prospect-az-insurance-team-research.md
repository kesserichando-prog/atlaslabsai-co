## Outreach Strategy Notes

### Best Approach
1. **Lead with ROI:** Show financial impact of automation
2. **Fix immediate pain:** Address email spam issue first
3. **Leverage strength:** Automation amplifies their personal service, doesn't replace it
4. **Competitive angle:** Beat digital insurers with better experience
5. **Pilot proposal:** Offer small automation to prove value

### Likely Objections & Responses
- **"We tried automation and it hurt us"** → "That was bad implementation, we'll do it right"  
- **"We can't afford it"** → "ROI calculator shows 6-month payback"
- **"Our customers want personal service, not tech"** → "Automation gives you more time for personal service"
- **"We're too small"** → "Actually small teams benefit most from automation"

### Message Framing
- "Help Charlotte serve more clients in less time"
- "Fix the spam email issue that's hurting your reputation"
- "Quote 5x faster than you do now"
- "Stop 'shopping around' manually and let technology do it"
