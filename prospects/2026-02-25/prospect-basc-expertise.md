## Why They Need Automation

### The Accounting Firm Efficiency Gap

Accounting firms spend 40-60% of their time on non-billable tasks: document collection, data entry, chasing clients for information, and administrative work. With only 8 staff, BASC Expertise likely faces capacity constraints during tax season and cannot scale efficiently without automation.

### Core Business Challenges

#### 1. **Client Document Collection & Data Entry**
- Tax documents from clients (W-2s, 1099s, receipts, bank statements)
- Bookkeeping data from client accounting systems (QuickBooks, Excel)
- Manual entry of data into tax software
- Chasing clients for missing documents

**Manual Pain Points**: Time-intensive manual entry. Documents arrive via email, mail, portal—multiple channels to monitor. Clients delay submission, causing bottlenecks during busy periods.

#### 2. **Tax Preparation Workflows**
- Individual returns and business returns
- Workpaper preparation and organization
- Review and approval processes
- E-filing and client delivery
- Post-filing support (amendments, notices)

**Manual Pain Points**: Many accountants still use checklists and manual workflows. No automated progression or alerts. Workpapers prepared manually or with basic templates.

#### 3. **Client Communication & Document Sharing**
- Year-round communications (questions, updates, deadlines)
- Document delivery (tax returns, financial statements)
- Secure sharing of sensitive financial information
- deadline reminders and compliance notices

**Manual Pain Points**: Likely email-based communication. No centralized client portal. Documents emailed insecurely or through basic portal solutions. Manual reminders sent.

#### 4. **Payroll Processing**
- Weekly/biweekly/bimonthly payroll for business clients
- Tax calculation and withholding
- Federal and state tax filings
- Year-end W-2/1099 processing
- Direct deposit and paystub distribution

**Manual Pain Points**: Time-consuming without automation integration. Manual data entry from timesheets. Compliance deadlines risk missing without alerts.

#### 5. **Bookkeeping Services**
- Monthly bookkeeping for business clients
- Bank statement reconciliation
- Accounts payable/receivable tracking
- Financial reporting
- Clean-up work for messy books

**Manual Pain Points**: Manual entry from bank statements and receipts. Time-intensive for clients with high transaction volume. Billable hours limited by manual processes.

#### 6. **Practice Growth Constraints**
- 8 staff can handle finite number of clients
- Tax season overload
- Limited time for business development/growth
- Hard to add new services without more staff

**Manual Pain Points**: Cannot scale revenue efficiently. Each new client requires proportional staff time. Profit margin squeezed by manual work.
