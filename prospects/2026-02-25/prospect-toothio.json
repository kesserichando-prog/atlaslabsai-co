Toothio's on-demand model creates urgency that exacerbates manual process inefficiencies. Automation can streamline job order processing, automate candidate matching algorithms, enable self-service scheduling for dental practices, automate time tracking and payroll integration, automate client communication and notifications, and optimize the matching algorithm over time - allowing Toothio to scale to more dental practices and professionals while maintaining quality and response times.",
