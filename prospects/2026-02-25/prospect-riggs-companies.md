## Why They Need Automation

### Core Business Challenges

#### 1. **Multi-Site Project Management**
Managing construction projects across different locations requires coordination of:
- Crew scheduling and time tracking
- Material ordering and delivery logistics
- Subcontractor coordination
- Safety compliance and reporting
- Progress tracking and client communications

**Manual Pain Points**: Likely using spreadsheets or generic project management tools that don't integrate well with construction-specific workflows. ESOP calculations for employee time tracking would be manual and error-prone.

#### 2. **Estimating and Bid Preparation**
Commercial bidding requires:
- Accurate material takeoffs
- Labor cost estimation
- Timeline projections
- Profitability analysis
- Proposal generation

**Manual Pain Points**: Time-consuming manual calculations. Inconsistent quoting processes across estimators. Lost revenue from underbidding or losing contracts from slow response times.

#### 3. **Resource Allocation**
With 50+ employees across multiple job sites:
- Crew assignment optimization
- Equipment and material distribution
- Skill matching for project requirements
- Overtime and labor cost management

**Manual Pain Points**: Excel-based scheduling or inefficient communication chains. Potential for resource conflicts or idle time.

#### 4. **ESOP Administration**
As an employee-owned company:
- Tracking employee hours and contributions
- Calculating ESOP allocations
- Providing transparency to employees
- Annual valuation reporting

**Manual Pain Points**: Complex calculations likely done in spreadsheets. High error risk if disconnected from actual time tracking systems.

### Growth Signals Indicating Scale-Up Opportunity

1. **Inc. 5000 Recognition**: Multiple years on the fastest-growing companies list
2. **Record-Setting Projects**: 418,900 lb tilt panels showcase capability for complex projects
3. **Awards**: Top Workplace (2022, 2024), Tilt-up Achievement Awards
4. **Expansion**: Growing into new facility types (data centers are recent addition)

These growth indicators suggest the company is scaling rapidly and likely feeling growing pains from manual processes.
