With 3 attorneys handling everything from intake to settlements, manual processes create bottlenecks in client acquisition, case management, deadline tracking, and compliance. Automation can streamline the consultation intake, automate deadline reminders for EEOC filings, organize evidence collection, improve client communication, and automate billing - allowing the firm to grow revenue without proportional staff increases.",
