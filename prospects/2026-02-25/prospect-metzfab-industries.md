## Pain Points & Automation Opportunities

### 1. Complex Job Scheduling - HIGH IMPACT
Multiple advanced machines (CNC press brake, waterjet, laser cutting, robotics) require sophisticated scheduling.

**Automation:** Shop management system with predictive scheduling, equipment optimization, WIP tracking.

**ROI:** 20-30% throughput increase, better utilization, fewer bottlenecks.

### 2. Automated Quoting for Diverse Services - HIGH IMPACT
Complex job quoting across 18+ service types with varied complexity.

**Automation:** Intelligent quoting engine with historical data, machine time estimation, material calculation.

**ROI:** 40-60% quoting time reduction, faster response to customers.

### 3. Project Management for Complex Assemblies - MEDIUM IMPACT
Multi-step fabrication projects from design through assembly need coordination.

**Automation:** Project management system with milestone tracking, dependencies, documentation.

**ROI:** Fewer delays, better customer communication, higher throughput.

### 4. Design-to-Production Workflow - MEDIUM IMPACT
CAD/CAM capabilities but integration with production may be manual.

**Automation:** Automated CAM-to-machine workflow, revision control, design approval system.

**ROI:** Faster time-to-production, fewer transfer errors.

### 5. Customer Communication - MEDIUM IMPACT
No customer portal visible; manual project status updates.

**Automation:** Customer portal with real-time status, documents, milestone notifications.

**ROI:** Reduced customer inquiries, higher satisfaction, professional presentation.

### 6. Equipment Management -EDIUM-HIGH IMPACT
Advanced equipment (robotic welding, 5-axis waterjet) needs maintenance tracking.

**Automation:** Maintenance scheduling, utilization tracking, predictive maintenance alerts.

**ROI:** Reduced downtime, longer equipment life, better ROI on expensive equipment.
