## Current State & Pain Points

### 1. Manual Quoting Process - HIGH IMPACT
**Evidence:** Website offers "Request a Quote" form with no automated pricing. Custom fabrication requires manual calculations of material, labor, and machine time.

**Automation Opportunity:**
- Automated quoting system for standard parts based on material and complexity
- Quick-estimate calculator for common fabrications
- Template library for repeat customer parts
- Real-time material pricing integration
- Historical quote database for faster re-quoting

**Potential ROI:** 40-50% reduction in quoting time, faster response leading to higher close rates.

### 2. Shop Floor & Job Scheduling - HIGH IMPACT
**Evidence:** No mention of shop management software. Traditional fabrication shops use whiteboards or spreadsheets.

**Automation Opportunity:**
- Digital job board/kanban system
- Real-time machine scheduling optimization
- Work-in-progress (WIP) tracking
- Employee task assignment and time tracking
- Automated status updates to customers

**Potential ROI:** 20-30% increase in shop throughput, better on-time delivery, reduced machine idle time.

### 3. Inventory & Materials Management - MEDIUM IMPACT
**Evidence:** No inventory system mentioned. Most small fab shops track materials manually or in Excel.

**Automation Opportunity:**
- Digital inventory management system
- Barcode/QR code tracking for materials
- Automated reorder points for common materials
- Yield tracking and waste reduction
- Cost tracking by job for accurate pricing

**Potential ROI:** 15-25% reduction in material waste, improved cash flow management.

### 4. Customer Communication - MEDIUM IMPACT
**Evidence:** No customer portal or automated project updates visible. Manual phone/email updates typical.

**Automation Opportunity:**
- Customer portal for project status
- Automated milestone notifications (design approved, fabrication started, shipping)
- Document sharing platform (drawings, photos)
- Payment tracking and invoicing automation
- Post-project follow-up automation

**Potential ROI:** Reduced customer inquiries, improved satisfaction, higher repeat business.

### 5. Design-to-Production Workflow - MEDIUM IMPACT
**Evidence:** Has design and programming capabilities but process likely manual with email/file transfers.

**Automation Opportunity:**
- Automated design file processing (DXF to machine)
- Digital design approval workflow
- Revision control and versioning
- Automated job routing based on design complexity
- Integration with CAD software

**Potential ROI:** Faster time to production, reduced errors in transfer, better design reuse.

### 6. Quality Control Documentation - LOW-MEDIUM IMPACT
**Evidence:** No mention of QC systems beyond "high-quality parts" claims.

**Automation Opportunity:**
- Digital QC checklists per job
- Photo documentation of critical parts
- Non-conformance reporting system
- Certifications and inspection reports automation
- Trend analysis for process improvement

**Potential ROI:** Reduced rework, better customer trust, exportable QC records for aerospace/medical customers.

### 7. Sales & Lead Management - MEDIUM IMPACT
**Evidence:** No evidence of CRM system. Likely manual follow-up.

**Automation Opportunity:**
- CRM for lead tracking
- Automated follow-up sequences for quotes
- Customer segmentation for marketing
- Repeat customer reminders (annual re-orders)
- Referral tracking program

**Potential ROI:** Higher conversion rates, more repeat business, better sales forecasting.

## Why They Need Automation

1. **Profit Margin Erosion:** Manual quoting leads to underquoting or slow responses that lose business
2. **Throughput Bottlenecks:** Shop floor coordination affects lead times and machine utilization
3. **Cash Flow:** Manual inventory management ties up capital in excess materials
4. **Scalability Constraints:** Owner likely spends significant time on administrative tasks
5. **Customer Expectations:** Modern customers want real-time status, not phone updates
6. **Competitive Pressure:** Larger shops have modern systems; small shops lose on efficiency

## Summary

Precision Metal Products LLC is a **moderate-to-strong candidate** for automation services. The fabrication industry uniformly benefits from automation, and small owner-operated shops are particularly good targets because the owner feels every inefficiency personally. The main challenges will be the relatively low trust score (due to limited online presence) and likely budget constraints.

**Recommendation:** Pursue with strong focus on ROI and shop floor improvement. Start with quoting automation as it directly impacts revenue, then expand to operations if the pilot succeeds. Leverage the veteran-owned story and family business values as a connection point.
