With nearly 50 years in operation and high seasonal demand (Phoenix summers hitting 110°F+), manual processes create bottlenecks in customer service, technician utilization, and revenue capture. Automation can transform scheduling/dispatch, automate customer communications (confirmations, reminders, follow-ups), streamline invoicing and collections, optimize routing, and manage maintenance contracts - allowing Howard Air & Plumbing to serve more customers with existing staff while improving customer satisfaction.",
