## Automation Opportunity Signals

### Manual Process Indicators (Inferred)
1. **Construction Industry Norm**: Construction notoriously manual, especially mid-market firms (~50 employees)
2. **ESOP Complexity**: Employee ownership requires precise time tracking and contribution calculations—likely spreadsheet-based
3. **Bid Preparation**: Competing on larger projects (data centers) requires faster, more accurate estimating
4. **Multi-Site Coordination**: Active projects across Phoenix metro area
5. **Safety Requirements**: OSHA compliance, client safety requirements—increasingly digitized industry-wide

### Technology Stack (Unknown)
- Website is modern but no explicit tech mentions
- Likely common construction tools: Procore? Autodesk? Excel? Unknown
- Opportunity in this uncertainty—they may be under-automated

---

## Competitive Landscape

### Local Competitors
- Multiple Phoenix-area concrete contractors
- Most don't emphasize technology in marketing
- Riggs' ESOP and awards differentiate them—but automation gap not yet a competitive lever

### National Construction Tech Trends
- Construction firms 50-500 employees increasingly adopting:
  - Construction PM software (Procore, Autodesk Construction Cloud, Buildertrend)
  - Estimating automation (PlanSwift, STACK, Bluebeam)
  - Digital time tracking (Construction time clock apps, mobile solutions)
- Early adopters seeing 15-20% efficiency gains
