2. Client intake and consultation scheduling
3. Evidence collection and organization
4. Client communication and status updates
5. Compliance management across federal/state laws
6. Case documentation workflow
7. Settlement tracking
8. Billing and invoicing

## Competitive Landscape

- Houk Employment Attorneys (3 lawyers) - target prospect
- May, Potenza, Baran & Gillespie (22 lawyers) - too large
- Alcock & Associates (17 lawyers) - large

**Observation:**
