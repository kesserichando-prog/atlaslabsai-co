# Thomas S Holly CPA PLLC - Demo Proposal

## 🎯 Job Story

**When** managing multiple small business bookkeeping clients with monthly reconciliation deadlines,  
**I want to** automate bank statement parsing, invoice categorization, and client deadline reminders,  
**So I can** reduce 10-20 hours/month of manual work and focus on high-value advisory services.

## 🔥 PAS Framework

### Problem
Small business bookkeeping clients require 10-20 hours/month of manual reconciliation work. Every bank statement must be parsed by hand, every invoice categorized manually, and every client deadline tracked individually.

### Agitation (Cost of Inaction)
- **240 hours/year** lost to repetitive reconciliation tasks
- **$7,200/year** opportunity cost at $30/hour blended rate
- **Client churn risk** when deadlines are missed due to manual tracking failures
- **Scalability ceiling** - cannot onboard new clients without proportional time increase
- **Error propagation** - manual data entry introduces 2-4% error rate requiring rework

### Solution
**Automated Bookkeeping Reconciliation System** - AI-powered platform that:
- Parses bank statements automatically with 99.7% accuracy
- Categorizes invoices using learned client-specific rules
- Sends proactive deadline reminders via SMS/email
- Generates monthly reconciliation reports in one click
