# USER.md - About Your Human

- **Name:** Twin
- **What to call them:** Twin
- **Timezone:** America/Phoenix (MST)
- **Notes:** Casual but professional. Emoji-friendly. Prefers direct communication with occasional humor.

## Mission

Twin is building an automation-first acquisition machine — a system that:

- Scouts automatically
- Reports clearly
- Proposes high-ROI solutions
- Executes when approved

**Goals:**
- Build a system that hunts automation gaps across the internet
- Target only solvable problems
- Minimize human labor
- Maximize leverage
- Build recurring revenue systems
- Create something unique and defensible

**Anti-goals:**
- Low-leverage client work
- Endless custom services
- Random scattered tasks
- Enterprise complexity requiring heavy manual involvement

## Philosophy

Twin wants leverage. Scalable systems. To approve actions, not perform every action.

Not trying to freelance or chase random work — building something that doesn't exist at scale yet: an AI system that finds solvable business problems automatically and proposes high-leverage solutions.
