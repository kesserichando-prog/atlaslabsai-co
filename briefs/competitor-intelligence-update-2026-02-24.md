   - Quarterly pricing review (after 5+ deals closed)

### Medium Term (3-6 months)

1. **Review Positioning After 5 Deals**
   - If win rate >80%: May be underpriced—consider 10-20% increase
   - If win rate <50%: Adjust targeting or messaging (not pricing)
   - Update pricing intelligence document with real data

2. **Regional Expansion (Arizona)**
   - Expand to Tucson, Flagstaff, Scottsdale
   - Maintain local focus while growing geography
   - Competitor threat: Low (no regional automation agencies)

3. **Hire/Contract First Account Manager**
   - Handle outreach to Phoenix businesses
   - Focus Atlas on strategy + technical work
   - Budget: $3,000-$5,000/month (one AM)

### Long Term (6-12 months)

1. **Pricing Tier Introduction**
   - **Sprint Package:** $1K setup + $300/mo (simple workflows)
   - **Standard Package:** $3K setup + $800/mo (current pricing)
   - **Enterprise Package:** $5K setup + $1,500/mo (complex systems)
   - Maintain profit margin while offering options

2. **Competitor Moat Building**
   - Publish case studies publicly (atlaslabsai.co/clients)

   - Industry intelligence as competitive advantage
   - Build referral network (first 5 clients = referral engine)

3. **Exit Strategy Considerations**
   - Acquisition potential by: Deloitte Digital, Accenture Automation, or regional consulting firms

   - Timeline: 12-24 month horizon (after 15-20 clients)

## Pricing Experiment Proposals

### Test 1: "Pricing Based on Recovered Value"
**Hypothesis:** Charge 4% of revenue recovered in first month (no setup fee)
**Example:** Recover $50,000 in no-show revenue → charge $2,000 first month
**Test Clients:** Healthcare/dental (quantifiable revenue)
**Risk Profile:** High (if ROI underdelivered, lose revenue)
**Timeline:** Q2 2026 (after 3 proven case studies)

### Test 2: "Performance-Based Model"
**Hypothesis:** No upfront cost, charge monthly only if KPIs met
**Example:** Reduce no-shows by 20% → pay $800; if <20% → no charge
**Test Clients:** High-trust leads (85+ score)
**Risk Profile:** Medium (revenue delayed, but aligned incentives)
**Timeline:** Q3 2026 (after pricing confidence validated)

### Test 3: "Annual Prepay Discount"
**Hypothesis:** 10% discount for 12-month prepayment
**Example:** Annual contract: $8,800 instead of $9,600 (Dental on Central)
**Benefit:** Upfront cash, client commitment
**Timeline:** Q2 2026 (when cash flow needed for expansion)
