**Run ID:** scout:pain-point-mining:cannabis:2026-02-26-001
**Runtime:** 2m38s | **Tokens:** 384.9k

**Prospects Found:**
1. Story McDowell (Nature's Medicine) — Trust 88, Opportunity 90
2. JARS Cannabis — Trust 90, Opportunity 85
3. Trulieve — Trust 95, Opportunity 95 (major MSO)

**Patterns:**

## 05:01 AM MST — ⚠️ CRITICAL ALERT: Catalyst Integration Gap

**Issue:** Scout returned 3 prospects with Trust ≥70 but Catalyst didn't auto-spawn

**Root Cause:** Missing Scout → Lead DB → Catalyst trigger integration

**Impact:**
- Catalyst 60s SLA violated
- Manual intervention required for every demo build
- Trulieve (Trust 95) idle when it should be fast-tracked

**Required Fix:**
Create Scout artifact ingester that:
1. Reads prospect JSON from `prospects/` directory
2. Creates Lead records in Mission Control database
3. Sets `status='Qualified'` for Trust Score ≥70
4. Triggers Catalyst for auto-demo build

**Priority:** HIGH — Blocks end-to-end prospect-to-demo automation

**Resolution:** Awaiting user approval to build integration

---

## 05:01 AM MST — Heartbeat Check

**Systems Checked:**
- ✅ Pipeline: Still 5 demos, no new Draft/Ready items
- ✅ Scout: Run completed 27 minutes ago, 3 prospects identified
- ⚠️ **GAP IDENTIFIED:** Scout returned prospects with Trust ≥70 (Story McDowell 88, JARS 90, Trulieve 95) but Catalyst didn't auto-spawn to build demos

**Issue:**
Scout returns artifacts (JSON + MD) uploaded to Mission Control Documents, but Catalyst trigger requires database records with `status='Qualified'`. Missing integration layer:
1. Scout artifacts → Database Lead records (auto-creation)
2. Lead status='Qualified' → Catalyst auto-spawn

**Impact:** 2 high-priority prospects (Story McDowell, JARS) waiting for demo build. Catalyst SLA (60s) not met due to missing automation.

**Next action:** Document gap in MEMORY.md for implementation priority
