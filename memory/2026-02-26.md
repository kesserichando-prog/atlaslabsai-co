## 04:34 AM MST — Scout Pain-Point Mining (Cannabis)

**Run ID:** scout:pain-point-mining:cannabis:2026-02-26-001
**Runtime:** 2m38s | **Tokens:** 384.9k

**Prospects Found:**
1. Story McDowell (Nature's Medicine) — Trust 88, Opportunity 90
2. JARS Cannabis — Trust 90, Opportunity 85
3. Trulieve — Trust 95, Opportunity 95 (major MSO)

**Patterns:**
- Online order processing delays
- Complex pricing/deal management
- Enterprise-cannabis integration gap
- Multi-location scalability challenges
- Compliance reporting automation needs
- Inventory synchronization across locations

**Status:** Scout complete, artifacts uploaded to Documents

## 05:01 AM MST — ⚠️ CRITICAL ALERT: Catalyst Integration Gap

**Issue:** Scout returned 3 prospects with Trust ≥70 but Catalyst didn't auto-spawn

**Root Cause:** Missing Scout → Lead DB → Catalyst trigger integration

**Impact:**
- Catalyst 60s SLA violated
- Manual intervention required for every demo build
- Trulieve (Trust 95) idle when it should be fast-tracked

**Required Fix:**
Create Scout artifact ingester that:
1. Reads prospect JSON from `prospects/` directory
2. Creates Lead records in Mission Control database
3. Sets `status='Qualified'` for Trust Score ≥70
4. Triggers Catalyst for auto-demo build

**Priority:** HIGH — Blocks end-to-end prospect-to-demo automation

**Resolution:** Awaiting user approval to build integration

---

## 06:31 AM MST — Heartbeat Check (Evening Rotation)

**Systems Checked:**
- ✅ Pipeline: Scout artifacts exist (3 cannabis prospects), but NOT in Mission Control DB
- ✅ Scout: Cannabis pain-point mining completed (Story McDowell, JARS, Trulieve)
- ❌ Catalyst: Did NOT auto-spawn for Trust ≥70 prospects
- ✅ Git: No new commits (alert pending resolution)
- ✅ Skills Discovery: 5 new automation skills found on ClawHub

**New Skills Discovered:**
1. automation-workflows (3.632) — General workflow templates
2. ai-web-automation (3.393) — AI-powered web scraping/forms
3. data-automation-service (3.283) — ETL pipelines
4. x-post-automation (3.473) — Twitter posting
5. windows-ui-automation (3.465) — Desktop automation

**Priority:** automation-workflows for demo builder acceleration (test needed)

**Metrics Updated:**
- 16 heartbeats today
- 23 tasks completed
- 20 prospects found (10 runs)
- Skills tracking updated

**Status:** Pipeline BLOCKED — Scout → Catalyst integration missing

---

## 07:03 AM MST — Git Maintenance

**Actions:**
- ✅ Committed memory and skills tracking updates
- ✅ Clean commit: "Update memory and skills tracking (2026-02-26 evening)"
- 📊 68 files still uncommitted (working changes + untracked assets)

**Status:** Git clean for committed files, backlog remains

## 04:34 AM MST — Scout Pain Point Mining (Cannabis)

**Assignment:** `scout:pain-point-mining:cannabis:2026-02-26-001`
**Runtime:** 2m38s | **Model:** glm-4.7:cloud

**Prospects Found (3):**
1. **Story McDowell (Nature's Medicine)** — Trust: 88, Opportunity: 90

2. **JARS Cannabis** — Trust: 90, Opportunity: 85
   - Employees: 100-500
   - Pain: Complex pricing/deal management
   - Priority: High

3. **Trulieve** — Trust: 95, Opportunity: 95
   - Employees: 5,000-10,000 (major MSO)
   - Pain: Enterprise-cannabis integration gap
   - Priority: Medium (enterprise territory)

**Patterns Identified:**
- Multi-location scalability challenges
- Compliance reporting automation needs
- Inventory synchronization across locations

**Opportunity Score:** 90

**User Notification:** Sent to Twin about the 3 high-value prospects and pattern insights.

## 05:01 AM MST — Heartbeat Check

**Systems Checked:**
- ✅ Pipeline: Still 5 demos, no new Draft/Ready items
- ✅ Scout: Run completed 27 minutes ago, 3 prospects identified
- ⚠️ **GAP IDENTIFIED:** Scout returned prospects with Trust ≥70 (Story McDowell 88, JARS 90, Trulieve 95) but Catalyst didn't auto-spawn to build demos

**Issue:**
Scout returns artifacts (JSON + MD) uploaded to Mission Control Documents, but Catalyst trigger requires database records with `status='Qualified'`. Missing integration layer:
1. Scout artifacts → Database Lead records (auto-creation)
2. Lead status='Qualified' → Catalyst auto-spawn

**Impact:** 2 high-priority prospects (Story McDowell, JARS) waiting for demo build. Catalyst SLA (60s) not met due to missing automation.

**Next action:** Document gap in MEMORY.md for implementation priority
