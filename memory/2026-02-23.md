## Telegram Channel Restoration (8:00 PM - 10:00 PM MST)

**Root Cause Diagnosed:**
- Telegram plugin was `disabled` (Plugins: 4/37 loaded)
- Config error: missing plugins.allow section in openclaw.json
- Bot token needed (old token invalid - got 401 Unauthorized)

**Resolution Steps:**
1. Enabled Telegram plugin: `openclaw plugins enable telegram`
2. Manually added `plugins.allow: ["telegram"]` to config
3. User created new Telegram bot token via BotFather
4. Added token to channel: `openclaw channels add --channel telegram --token <TOKEN>`
5. Verified connection: Channel shows "ON | OK", 1 session active

**Current Status:**
- ✅ Telegram plugin enabled and loaded
- ✅ Bot token configured
- ✅ 2 Telegram targets connected (6401..., 5502...)
- ✅ Both sessions active

**Cron Jobs Re-Enabled:**
- Created `afternoon-progress-2` job to send to secondary Telegram
- Updated `afternoon-progress` to primary Telegram
- All briefs now deliver to both Telegrams instead of webchat

## 💡 KEY INSIGHTS & PATTERNS

1. **Manual = Expensive:** Every industry hit on the same problem—manual processes are invisible cost centers
2. **High Trust Industries Outperform:** Healthcare, Accounting, Real Estate have higher conversion rates
3. **No-shows Universal:** 20-30% no-show across healthcare/dental industries = clear automation ROI
4. **Phone is Dead Channel:** Restaurants, medical clinics, all drowning in phone calls = opportunity for automation
5. **Verification Critical:** Frank Aazami changed brokerages—web search prevented wasted outreach
6. **Competitor Gap:** DIY tools (Zapier/Make) leave huge opening for done-for-you services
7. **Phoenix Market Ripe:** Local businesses struggling with same problems, no focused automation agencies
