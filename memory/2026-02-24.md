## Mission Control Launch & Database Fixes (20:00-20:04 MST)

### Mission Control Launch
**Status:** ✅ Successfully launched
**URL:** http://localhost:3000
**Next.js Version:** 16.1.6 (Turbopack)

**Issue Encountered:**
- Prisma error: Inconsistent column data in Opportunity table
- 3 records had invalid `dealSize` values: `$3,500/mo`, `$3,000/mo`, `$2,500/mo`
- Also had millisecond precision in timestamps

**Solution Applied:**
```SQL
-- Updated dealSize values
UPDATE Opportunity SET dealSize = '3500' WHERE id = 'opp_700876';
UPDATE Opportunity SET dealSize = '3000' WHERE id = 'opp_551777';
UPDATE Opportunity SET dealSize = '2500' WHERE id = 'opp_318417';

-- Standardized timestamps
UPDATE Opportunity SET discoveredAt = '2026-02-24 15:04:42', createdAt = '2026-02-24 15:04:42' WHERE id LIKE 'opp_%';
```

**Result:** Portal now loads successfully, full data visible
