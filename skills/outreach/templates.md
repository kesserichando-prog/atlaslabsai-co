# Outreach Templates

## Subject Lines That Work

**Patterns that get opens:**
- Question format: "Quick question about [their recent work]"
- Mutual connection: "[Name] suggested I reach out"
- Specific reference: "Re: your [article/talk/post] on [topic]"
- Curiosity gap: "[Their company] + [your value prop]"

**Character limit:** Under 50. Mobile previews cut at ~35.

**Test:** Always draft 3-5 variations per campaign.
